Boecker et al. 2021,Deciphering the physiological response of Escherichia coli under high ATP demand,ecoli,glucose,aerobic batch with ATPase ,"For aerobic cultivation, cells were diluted 1:500 into chemically defined medium (MM: 4 g/l glucose, 34 mM NaH2PO4, 64 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 μM Fe(SO4)4, 300 μM MgSO4, 1 μM ZnCl2, 10 μM CaCl2, adapted from (Tanaka et al, 1967)), containing 0.01 mM of IPTG (except for “WT”) and cultivated at 37°C and 250 rpm overnight. The cells were centrifuged at 5,000 g, washed, and used to inoculate 25 ml of fresh MM (containing 0.01 mM IPTG, except for “WT”) to an optical density at 420 nm (OD420) of 0.2 (0.4 for the HC ATPase strain).
