# Warburg Effect Model

**System Requirements:** 

This project has been tested on the following operating systems: 
macOS Big Sur 11.7.10

Before beginning, ensure you have met the following requirements: 

•	Python 3.7 or 3.8: The code in these notebooks are compatible with Python 3.7 or 3.8. 

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to install JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook. We recommend creating a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies easily. All package dependencies (i.e. numpy, pandas, etc.) are called in the respective Jupyter Notebook file. 

**Installation instructions:** 

Clone the repository: ‘git clone https://github.com/DenisTitovLab/WarburgEffectModel.git’

**Instructions for use: **

The Jupyter notebooks contain the complete set of code and datasets to reproduce the figures presented in the manuscript. The expected run time for all notebooks in sequence is less than one hour of local computational time.
